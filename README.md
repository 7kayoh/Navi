# Navi

Navi is a simple routing library that utilizes the unique declarative design Fusion possesses, providing a much less steep learning curve for beginners at frontend development.

Bear in mind that Navi is still a beta product, many advanced features are still lacking and may not be added in later versions. For those purposes, consider using the much more advanced version -- Koute.
